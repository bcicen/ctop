Top-like interface for container metrics

`ctop` provides a concise and condensed overview of real-time metrics for multiple containers:
<p align="center"><img src="_docs/img/grid.gif" alt="ctop"/></p>

as well as an [single container view][single_view] for inspecting a specific container.

`ctop` comes with built-in support for Docker and runC; connectors for other container and cluster systems are planned for future releases.

## Building
